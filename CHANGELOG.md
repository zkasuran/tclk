## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `probeRoomCreation()` helper to check venue capacity before attempting a deal. When a venue
  is at its room limit (global cap or per-client daily budget), `tclk-offers` cannot be created
  and no deal can bootstrap. The probe attempts to create an ephemeral test room and reports
  whether creation is available or refused. `examples/live-deal.mjs` now probes up front and
  provides clear guidance when capacity is exhausted, addressing the bootstrap half of #3.
- SPEC.md §2 now documents the bootstrap dependency on room creation as a known sharp edge,
  including the two capacity mechanisms venues typically enforce and mitigation guidance.

### Fixed

- `foldTranscript` now emits warnings when transcript metadata anomalies (sequence gaps,
  ordering violations, backwards timestamps) or deadline-sensitive transitions rely on
  unsigned venue timestamps. Detects the exact attack from #96: tampered `timestampMs`
  fields that flip claimed→refunded outcomes while all signatures remain valid. Anomaly
  checks run only on signed records; unsigned records are skipped to avoid false positives
  when partial transcripts are analyzed.
- `tclk_post_frame` now accepts exact decimal-string nonces in addition to safe integer
  numbers, so signed Technocore nonces above JavaScript's safe-integer range are preserved
  without precision loss. Unsafe numeric nonces (> 2^53 - 1) are rejected at the MCP schema
  boundary rather than silently rounded.

### Added

- A schema-owned tclk/1 frame field contract, canonical settlement-rail registry and
  intersection-based, order-independent rail matching helpers. Generated decoder fields
  and the normative `SPEC.md` table are checked for drift in CI.
- A signed `heartbeat` frame for non-authoritative liveness while a contract is accepted
  or locked, without abusing terminal receipts or changing contract state.
- A hosted deployment of the MCP server at `https://tclk.technocore.chat/mcp`, streamable
  HTTP, no account and no key. It is the no-custody Worker build: it binds neither
  `TECHNOCORE_SIGNING_KEY` nor `TCLK_PAYMENT_KEY` and refuses to serve if either is present,
  so `tclk_post_frame` passes a caller's signature through or returns the signing challenge,
  and `tclk_adaptor_presign` refuses and names where pre-signing can be done instead. The
  stdio build remains the right choice wherever a local process can run — `mcp/worker/`
  documents what a shared instance costs, including that frames leave from its IP and share
  one rate budget.

### Changed

- Transcript folding now consumes complete signed records instead of bare `lines` plus
  optional positional metadata. A record keeps its exact line, room, sequence, venue
  timestamp, sender, nonce and signature together; `foldTranscript` verifies the signature
  and sender binding and applies each frame at that record's timestamp. The MCP
  `tclk_read_room` tool returns this shape directly and supports `full: true` for strict,
  byte-exact `/export` history, while `tclk_apply_transcript` accepts only `records` and has
  no fallback clock. `examples/audit-export.mjs` performs the same audit offline; sender,
  room, nonce and line are signature-covered, while timestamp and sequence remain explicitly
  trusted venue/export metadata (#11, #23).

### Fixed

- `tclk_read_room`'s bounded window read no longer fails the whole call when the venue
  returns one message with a malformed envelope. A room is world-writable, so a single
  hostile line — a `nonce` that is not decimal text, a non-string `from` — used to throw
  out of the `messages.map`, denying every reader the rest of the room. Each message is
  now normalized on its own: one that will not normalize is set aside in a new `malformed`
  array with its seq and reason, exactly as a fold reports a bad line, so no record is
  silently lost and `lastSeq` stays correct for paging. The `full` export path keeps the
  opposite rule and is unchanged: an export claims to be the complete history, where a
  partial answer is indistinguishable from a whole one, so `parseTranscriptExport` refuses
  the file rather than hand back a transcript with a hole in it. A window claims only a
  bounded view and already reports `lastSeq`, so naming the seq it could not read keeps
  that slice honest.
- `applyFrame` now rejects `receipt` frames whose `rail` or `ref` contradicts the contract's
  locked settlement terms, or that assert a settlement rail on a `cancelled` contract where
  no lock was ever established.
- `extractWitness` in the Schnorr adaptor module now returns `null` if the scalar difference
  is zero, matching scalar range validation and preventing emission of an invalid zero witness.
- `hexToU8a` is fail-closed again for every input `isHex` rejects. It silently returned an
  empty array for `""`, the one non-hex input it accepted, so a caller that length-checked
  the result could not tell zero bytes from a malformed argument; `0x` remains the spelling
  for zero bytes. Its refusal now reports the input's length instead of quoting it, matching
  the no-echo rule `mcp/src/signing.ts` already states — `hashLockFromPreimage` and
  `pointLockFromWitness` decode secret preimages and witnesses through this function, and the
  old message put a rejected secret into whatever log caught the throw.
- `applyFrame` now rejects `lock` frames when the refund window is already open
  (`nowMs >= refundAfterMs`), matching the settlement rail's refusing-to-lock invariant
  and preventing a phantom `locked` state from which the payee can no longer claim (#43).
- New reveal/refund builders include the preceding lock's rail reference, and the state
  machine rejects a supplied mismatch. The field remains optional when decoding tclk/1 so
  contracts emitted before it existed remain replayable; making it mandatory is reserved
  for a versioned wire change.
- Rail migration: new frame builders and capability tokens trim and ASCII-lowercase ids,
  map `PaperRail`/`paper-rail` to canonical `paper`, and reject punctuation such as the live
  `flop-htlc.` typo instead of coercing it. `paper` is explicitly a non-value rehearsal rail
  (#31). New emissions reject unregistered ids, while tclk/1 decoding retains its historical
  lowercase free-form grammar, duplicate arrays, and exact membership so existing custom-rail
  contracts keep replaying. No golden wire constants changed.
- Transcript folds now reject otherwise-valid frames outside their protocol-mandated room,
  and the offline/live auditors select offer/accept pairs without reversing the board's
  append order.
- Pre-signature scalar validation now accepts only whole-byte hex encodings, rejecting
  odd-length strings before they reach cryptographic parsing (#24).
- The published `schema/tclk1-frames.schema.json` no longer admits frames the decoder
  rejects. `presig.s` was still the pre-byte-pair `^0x[0-9a-f]{1,64}$`, so the schema kept
  accepting exactly the odd-length scalars the decoder stopped taking in #24. `job.proto`,
  `job.id` and `job.context` carried no constraint at all, where the decoder requires a
  lowercase protocol id plus non-empty strings. SPEC §3 calls this file the artifact the
  decoder uses and the package ships it, so an independent implementation validating
  against the schema was being told to emit frames the reference refuses. Only the schema
  moved. No decoder behaviour, wire byte or golden vector changed.
- `decodeFrame` now enforces the same `MAX_FRAME_CHARS` room-message cap `encodeFrame` does.
  SPEC §2 states the cap as a property of a frame, and technocore refuses a longer text, so a
  longer line was never a stored room message. The check runs before `JSON.parse`, which bounds
  what one row of an untrusted `/export` can cost a `foldTranscript` call. No wire bytes move
  and no golden vector changes.
- Adaptor scalar parsing now rejects zero and out-of-range values instead of reducing them
  modulo the curve order, matching point-lock witness validation and preventing distinct
  byte strings from being treated as the same scalar (#27).
- `examples/live-deal.mjs` no longer leaves an unset `TECHNOCORE_URL` to blend into
  ordinary output. Unset means the run writes to the shared production venue, and it now
  says so in a warning a reader cannot miss before the first write — with working
  bash/zsh, PowerShell, and cmd.exe override syntax, since the POSIX-only line in the
  file's header was silently wrong on Windows (#6).
- Technocore note parsers now reject capability lists with empty rail entries and state
  pointers with malformed rail references, matching the encoders and keeping world-writable
  note input fail-closed.
- Unknown lock kinds now fail closed in statement validation and secret verification.
- `validateDeadlines` now rejects malformed clocks, non-finite safety margins, and
  unvalidated offer timestamps before doing arithmetic. A negative-infinite clock or an
  infinite refund deadline could previously manufacture a safe-looking window even though
  the helper promises to fail closed.
- `applyFrame` now rejects non-finite or negative wall-clock inputs without changing contract state.
- `decodePaperRecord` now rejects statements that do not match their declared lock kind,
  including wrong-length hash statements and malformed compressed point statements.
- `SPEC.md` §2 no longer claims a deal room is "derivable by the two parties and nobody
  else". It is not: the same bullet says the offer *and* the accept are both public in
  `tclk-offers`, and the room name is derived from exactly those two, so anyone who read the
  board derives it too. `mb-` bounds who may write and `p-` keeps it out of the listing;
  neither is confidentiality, and reads take no signature. A wrong privacy claim in a
  normative document is worse than no claim, because someone acts on it.
- `examples/live-deal.mjs` fails closed like the rest of the repository. A venue refusal —
  the room cap being the one a newcomer actually meets — now prints the venue's own reason
  and what to do about it, and exits 1, instead of dumping an unhandled rejection. Every
  `!res.ok` path routes through one `VenueError`, and both `uncaughtException` and
  `unhandledRejection` are hooked, because a rejected top-level `await` surfaces as the
  former and listening only for the latter catches nothing.
- Reject receipt frames whose claimed outcome contradicts the contract's terminal state,
  preventing a later reputation or spend-accounting consumer from accepting a false
  `claimed` / `refunded` / `cancelled` acknowledgment.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-01

First release. Alpha, testnet only: no rail here holds value, and the adaptor-signature
module is unaudited reference cryptography. Published as
[`@flop-labs/tclk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flop-labs/tclk) and
[`@flop-labs/tclk-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flop-labs/tclk-mcp).

### Added

- `@flop-labs/tclk` — the core library: frames, contract ids, hash/point locks, the fail-closed
  state machine, a `SettlementRail` interface with an in-process `MemoryRail` reference
  implementation, and A2A / Virtuals ACP status mappings.
- `@flop-labs/tclk-mcp` — a stateless MCP server exposing the protocol as tool calls, with
  optional local signing and posting to a technocore deployment.
- `SPEC.md` — the `tclk/1` protocol specification.
- `examples/htlc-walkthrough.md` — a two-agent HTLC choreography over technocore, shown both as
  raw curl and as MCP tool calls.
- Arbitration primitives for the shapes §8 says work today: `voteCommitment` /
  `verifyVoteCommitment` / `generateSalt` for commit-reveal voting (the contract id is
  inside the hash, so a verdict cannot be lifted between deals; the salt is what hides a
  verdict drawn from a set of two), and `splitSecret` / `combineSecret` /
  `splitWitness` / `combineWitness` for a unanimous panel. No new cryptography — sha256,
  XOR, and addition mod the curve order. k-of-n stays out on purpose.
- `SPEC.md` §8, arbitration: how to get a referee or a panel with what ships today — an
  arbiter holding the secret (a corrupt one can withhold or collude but cannot steal),
  a unanimous committee by splitting the preimage or adding scalar shares, and
  commit-reveal voting over signed room messages. k-of-n secret sharing is named as
  absent on purpose, with the reason. States plainly that all of these change who holds
  the secret and none makes a rail enforce a verdict, and marks where a policy-evaluating
  rail plugs in without altering a frame.
- `PaperRail` — a settlement rail that settles nothing, recording the lock/claim/refund
  lifecycle in venue notes (`NoteStore`, injected, so the library stays free of network
  code). It enforces the predicates a real rail must, so a client written against it is
  written correctly, and it holds no value and cannot: two-party fair exchange without an
  arbiter is impossible. For rehearsing the choreography, never for payment.
- `examples/live-deal.mjs` — one complete deal against a real technocore deployment: two
  identities sharing no state negotiate, lock, reveal and claim, then a third reader who
  holds no secrets re-reads the rooms and folds the transcript to check what happened.
- Rendezvous conventions, so two agents who have never met can find each other: public
  offers rest in the `tclk-offers` room (`OFFER_ROOM`), and an agent advertises the
  settlement rails it accepts with a `tclk1:<rail>,<rail>` token on its venue DID note
  (`capabilityToken` / `parseCapabilityToken`). Both are hints from world-writable
  surfaces — a signed frame is what proves anything. Documented in `SPEC.md` §2 and, on
  the venue side, in technocore's own `patterns.md`.
- A Cloudflare Worker deployment of the MCP server (`mcp/worker/`), serving stateless
  streamable HTTP at `POST /mcp`. It holds **no custody**: it neither reads nor accepts
  `TECHNOCORE_SIGNING_KEY` or `TCLK_PAYMENT_KEY`, and refuses to serve at all if either is
  bound, because a key on a server that answers many callers would sign for whoever called
  it. `tclk_post_frame` therefore passes a caller's signature through or returns the signing
  challenge, and `tclk_adaptor_presign` returns a structured refusal naming where pre-signing
  can be done instead. Its tool catalogue is generated from the stdio server rather than
  restated, so the two deployments cannot drift.
- Both packages ship `NOTICE` alongside `LICENSE`, as Apache-2.0 §4(d) requires — npm
  includes the licence automatically but not the notice it points at.
